Key Concepts
============

Before diving into the detailed guides, here are the key concepts you should understand:

**Cavity Modes**
   Optical cavity modes are represented as harmonic oscillators that can exchange energy with molecular degrees of freedom.

**Coupling Strength**
   The parameter `g` that determines how strongly the molecules interact with the cavity field.

**Finite vs Infinite Q**
   Whether the cavity mode can have finite momentum (finite-q) or is constrained to zero momentum (q=0).

**Thermostats**
   Independent temperature control for molecular and cavity degrees of freedom using various algorithms.

**Energy Conservation**
   The total energy (molecular + cavity + reservoir) should be conserved in properly configured simulations.

**Autocorrelation Functions**
   Time-dependent correlation functions like F(k,t) that reveal dynamic properties of the system.

Common Workflows
================

Here are some typical workflows you might follow:

**Basic Cavity Coupling Study**

1. Set up system with cavity coupling enabled

2. Set up automated parameter sweep
3. Run multiple replicas in parallel
4. Analyze trends and identify optimal parameters

**Correlation Function Analysis**

1. Enable F(k,t) tracking during simulation
2. Run for sufficient time to capture relaxation
3. Post-process correlation data
4. Fit exponential decays and extract timescales

**Performance Optimization**
